# Beginner 101

So you just downloaded this waifu collector gacha game called Azur Lane, you went through the starting tutorial and now met with a UI that makes no sense and guides that uses shorthand that makes no sense. Well let me explain the UI in a straight forward manner but before we begin here's a guide to [**BIND YOUR FOOKING ACCOUNT**](https://i.imgur.com/roy6tih.jpg), because you do not need to reroll in Azur Lane like most other gacha games, here's a short list of reasons why:

- Cubes and Gold are given in abundance when you are starting out. You'll get the ships you want eventually.
- A large majority of high value ships are not SSR rarity.
- Several of the most cost-effective, progression-friendly ships are drops, not builds.
- The tutorial can take 15 minutes or longer.
- SSR rates are 7% anyway.

## Useful Shorthands
<details>
  <summary> Rarity </summary>
  
  * Common: N (Grey/White)
  * Rare: R (Blue)
  * Elite: SR (Purple)
  * Super Rare: SSR (Yellow)
  * Ultra Rare: UR (Rainbow)
  * Prototype Rare: PR (Yellow)
  * Decisive Rare: DR (Rainbow)
  * Why is this like this? Don't ask me, idk, JP/FGO stuffs. It makes more sense to say it like that, EN do have a tendency to call Super Rare as SR but then get stumped on what to call purple cause Elite just sounds strange, what kind of rarity is Elite? Can someone please enlighten me on this?

<details>
  <summary> Factions </summary>
  
  * Sakura Empire: IJN
  * Eagle Union: USS
  * Royal Navy: HMS
  * Ironblood: KMS
  * Eastern Radiance: ROC/PRAN
  * North Union: SN
  * Iris Libre: FFNF
  * Vichya Dominion: MNF
  * Sardegna Empire: RN
  * There's also 2 common names for gears: SKC for German equipment and MLE for France equipment. Because these are present in the name so it's a bit more intuitive like that.

  <summary> Hull Class </summary>

- Vanguard Ships
  * Destroyer: DD ![DD](/resources/45px-DD_img40.png)
  * Light Cruiser: CL ![CL](/resources/45px-CL_img40.png)
  * Heavy Cruiser: CA ![CA](/resources/45px-CA_img40.png)
  * Large Cruiser: CB ![CB](/resources/45px-CB_img40.png)
- Main Fleet Ships

- Submarines
  * Submarines: SS ![SS](/resources/45px-SS_img40.png)
  * Submarine Carriers: SSV ![SSV](/resources/45px-SSV_img40.png)
- The ship hull class can be intuited through their icons but some just have downright the same icon therefore the only way to know what ship is in what hull class is in their ship profile in the dock. Explained later in the Dock section.
- What does all this even mean? 
     1. Vanguard ships including: DD, CL, CA and CB are your "frontline" ships, the ones that you actually control with your joystick. 
     2. Main fleet ships including: BB, BC, BBV, BM, CV, CVL and AR are your "backline" ships, who provide Artillery support fire and/or Airstrikes (BBVs provide both). 
     3. Submarine fleet including SS and SSV is another can of worm, unlocked after you clear chapter 3 map 4. A detailed guide about Submarines, Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) and Rescue Missions can be found [here made by pootatoast](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/User:Itsfyh/Submarines) (also in the helpful resources section of the readme)

<details>
  <summary> Miscellaneous acronyms and tips </summary>
  
  * **EXP from sorties means any fight that cost oil to do (daily challenges, Hard Mode, Story Map, Event maps, etc) and NOT Exercises, Dorm or Lecture Hall**
  * Equipment:
    - Class guns such as DD, CL, CA, BB are named accordingly: DD gun, CL gun, CA gun, BB gun
    - Torpedo/Submarine Torpedo: Torps/Sub torps
    - Dive Bombers: DB
    - Torpedo Bombers: TB
    - Anti-air Gun: AA
    - Auxiliary Equipment: Aux Gears
  * Limit Break: LB (all ships have 3 LB level: LB1, LB2 and LB3 or Max LB = MLB)
  * All __vanguard__ ships EXCEPT Collab ships have a skill, that is unlocked and upgraded by Limit Breaking, called All-out Assault: AOA for short.
  * Blueprints: as there are many type of blueprints in the game, from PR ship blueprints to equipment blueprints, they are all collectively called BPs
  * Research ships and blueprints are collectively called PR (prototype) so PR BPs generally refers to PR ship BP (the currency to enhance PR ships) or PR gears to refer to gears only obtainable from researches.
  * Cognitive Chips (Mental Units): are often shorthanded to Chips or Cog Chips. ~~what I'd like to call Mindbreaker Juice~~ 
  * Upgrade Parts are generally called Plates instead, e.g Torp Plates instead of Torpedo Parts, AA Plates instead of Anti-Air Gun Part,  Aux Plates instead of General Parts. Why is General Parts called Aux Plates? Because Auxiliary Equipment, the 2 slots that all ships have (3 for ARs), are upgraded with General Parts so it becomes Aux Plates.
  * BB/BC/gunbotes secondary is called Auxiliary Gun so Aux gun for short
  * Bombing Ships, the ships that is fast and make a beeline for your backline, are colloquially referred to as jihads.
  * This is how I refer to bulins and not reflective of how others do it: (they both say purin so it's hard to separate them based on the verbal tick)
    * Prototype Bulin MKII are gold bulins or just bulins
    * Universal Bulin are purins instead because B change to P means purple
  * OpSi: Operation Siren, a bundle of mess that has T4 plates to upgrade equipment past +10, Materials to builds Gear Lab equipments and META showdown.

## Main UI Explanation:
- [Top bar (element 1-6)](#top-bar-element-1-6)
- [Right side bar (element 7-12)](#right-side-bar-element-7-12)
- [Middle of the screen (element 13-18 and 27-30)](#middle-of-the-screen-element-13-18-and-27-30)
- [Bottom bar (element 19-26)](#bottom-bar-element-19-26)

<sup> I, Bucky </sup>

### Top bar (element 1-6)
- **Element 1:** **the LV. is your HQ or Commander level**, leveling up while grants little to no immediate benefits but is quintessential to your progression ([details here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Experience#Commander_XP)). Clicking on your secretary portrait takes you to your profile page. The profile page show you some basic data with some customization options. 
  * Top right "Style" is where you can customize your profile and chat border as well as medallion showcase. 
  * Bottom left is where you can change your greetings. 
  * Bottom right is where you can change your secretary as well as set your main secretary (left most, who gains 1 affection every 300-320 mins up to 90 without shrine buff*). You unlock more secretary slots for cosmetics after clearing the specified story maps. (Shrine is explained in element 18)
- **Element 2:** is your quick access side bar. You can collect Canteen Oil and Merchant Coins passive generation here without going to the Academy page, check on Commission teams, Tactical Classroom (NOT the Lecture Hall) and your Research Academy. One of the places you will check the most in the game.
- **Element 3:** Your "Beginner Missions" that gives a lot of resources and an SSR ship at the end (all 4 ship is also permanent available, recommendation for the ship is Hood if you don't have a BB/BC or Enterprise if you need a CV, Sandy is nice with retro but not that needed). Also at the bottom right of this mission screen have the research catch up missions that you can do to get EXP cards to fulfill your PR ships exp requirements (and 30 universal BPs to convert). 
- **Element 4:** is your current oil and oil soft cap, this cap is raised by 100 per HQ level. You can still gain more oil from buying oil with gems, commission, event/mission rewards or redeeming mails but will **NOT** be able to take oil from the canteen. The absolute oil **hard cap is 25,000 oil**. You cannot gain oil in any way if you hit this hard cap.
- **Element 5:** is your current gold and gold soft cap, this cap is raised by 600 per HQ level. Same deal as oil, still can gain more gold from buying gold with gems, commission, event/mission rewards or redeeming mails but will **NOT** be able to take gold from the merchant. The absolute gold **hard cap is 600,000 gold**. You cannot gain gold in any way if you hit this hard cap.
- **Element 6:** is your current gems stock, the premium currency so to speak, you can gain more by buying in the gems shop, some packs, 3 starring story map missions and some lucky urgent commissions (a minimal amount if any). Therefore as a F2P player, gems is a luxury and should always go into permanent upgrades instead of consumables. Recommended gem expenditure would be the following: 
  * **Dormitory slots: The 3rd dorm slot cost 300 gems, 4th cost 500 gems, 5th cost 800 gems and 6th cost 1200 gems.** The 2nd floor, which can be unlocked after you have fully expanded using furniture coins, cost **500 gems** and only provide morale regeneration and no exp gains. The 6th slot cost a lot and could be optionally skipped.
  * **Dock space expansion:** cost 200 gems per 10 slots until the 2000 dock space, after which it will cost 300 gems per 10 slots up to the cap of 3000 dock space.
  * Academy 3rd and 4th slot unlock: cost 500 gems and not that needed since you *eventually* don't need to raise so many skills as the main bottleneck is skill books.
  * Skins and Rings are luxury items afterwards.
  * Consumables come last such as oil refills, cubes, gold, ~~quick finishers~~, premium food, etc. (Premium food sometimes appear in Coin Shop and Medal Exchange so do pick them up as they are really valuable)

### Right side bar (element 7-12)
- **Element 7:** This is the memento section, including the following ordered from top to bottom: ![](https://i.imgur.com/xZ1nmjz.png)
    * **Archives** showcases all collectible ships ships in the game, with a handy filter in the top right.
    * **Retrofit** contains all retrofitted version of ships, also has a filter on the top right.
    * Note: Collection ratio includes all archives and retrofits *EXCEPT* collab ships
    * [**Bands (also known as Collection)**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/List_of_Collections) is a particular collection goal that rewards gems, dorm furniture, unique equipment or unlock exclusive ships. It is recommended to finish the Beaver Squad collection ASAP (LB2 at minimum level 30, all 5 ships is enough stars) because it gives one of the best evasion boosting auxiliary equipment in the game.
    * **Gallery:** Artwork collection. Some Loading screens and Intro artwork can be found here. No requirement to unlock them, you just need to download them individually to view them.
    * **Jukebox:** Music collection. Listen to the BGM here if you haven't gotten tired of it already.
- Old Archive Element not included in Screenshot but is now a separated element: [**Memories:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Memories) Cutscenes collection, you can rewatch all previously seen cutscenes here. You can use the Ships filter on the top right to find all the ships that has secretary questlines unique to them, to start it, set them as secretary in any slot and click on them. Except Akashi who has a longer questline to unlock her, details can be found [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akashi/Questline)
- **Element 8:** Ranking a.k.a tryhard flexing zone: Fleet power, Collection ratio, Exercise, Total event currency, Challenge Mode and event EX map all have rankings here.
- **Element 9:** Friends interface, rarely useful, add friend to slide into their DMs or visit their dorm. (Can also invite them to META fights, an OpSi end-game content)
- **Element 10:** Mail box, maintenance compensation, Exercise (PvP) promotion rewards, monthly pass are sent here. Mails do **NOT** have an expiration date and you can save the resources here for a rainy day when you need it. 
- **Element 11:** Notice a.k.a the announcement/patch note page everyone immediately close upon logging in the game, you can review it here.
- **Element 12:** Settings has the following
    * **Account** has your Account binding and secondary password to prevent others from unlocking ships or scrapped enhanced equipment
    * **Options** has FPS lock, Notification settings, Misc settings. Tinker around as you see fit
    * **Control** allows you to change your in-combat interface
    * **Audio** has volume sliders and audio/L2D updates

### Middle of the screen (element 13-18 and 27-30)
- **Element 13:** Lists of banners, events generally have 3-5 banners all running concurrently, including but not limited to ongoing event, time-limited skins, packs, dorm sets, construction rate-up.
- **Element 14:** Formation page, change your fleets and Meowfficers here. Note: Hard mode from story or event maps has specific requirements and need to be setup on the interface itself.
- **Element 15:** Battle/Sortie. Please refer to section [Sortie](#sortie-element-15)
- **Element 16:** Event page. Although the poster girl change from time to time, this button is static and will always direct you to the Event page which has all the current events on the left side that you can scroll through and some on the bottom part instead so do pay attention to the bottom bar too.
- **Element 17:** Event Maps, a shortcut to the event map instead of going to the story map then click on the event map icon.
- **Element 18:** Event "festival ground?", some events have their own festival ground that has varying facilities. Do go here everyday since these festival ground have either beneficial buffs or event mini-games.
- **Element 27:** Chat box. To turn it off, click on the red button at the bottom left. Alternatively click anywhere else on it to expand it: filter messages at the top, change room by clicking on the red Room button, change where you send your messages by clicking on the Bottom bar World/Guild button, send stickers by clicking the emoji face.
- **Element 28:** Inspect your secretary, as well as zoom-in/out, move around to view their artwork
- **Element 29:** AR camera interface, take a picture IRL and you can set your waifus fittingly in
- **Element 30:** Secretary cycle button, after you set more than one secretary, you can cycle between them using this button.

### Bottom bar (element 19-26)

Each of this is a section of its own due to their content. Some are just so long I kinda give up giving a run down since the details are on the wiki and the game does a sufficient job of explaining it.

### Shops --- Element 19

As many as there are, collectively are all here. They are mainly divided to 2 type: the ~~scam cat/whale~~ gem shop a.k.a [Akashi's shop](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akashi%27s_Shop) and all the other currency - the Munition shop a.k.a [Shiranui's shop](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shops).
  * [Akashi's shop](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akashi%27s_Shop) includes:
      1. Skin shop: sells skins obviously, some skins are L2D that cost a bit more but now you can admire your waifus as if they are 3D than as a 2D png.
      2. Gems shop: you can refill your gem stock using real world money. The monthly pass is also here which has the "best" value. All other gems pack has a first buy double bonus **which RESET every year on the anniversary**. (Btw, buying all 2x gems bonus is basically a 13$ per month subscription paying up front).
      3. Packs shop: the wiki list all the packs already. Nothing more to say about it besides: *Ring pack OP*
      4. Items shop: the wiki, besides listing all the items, also includes an oil refill price list. (Iirc, from HQ level 114 and above, using gems to directly refill oil is more efficient than buying the 2000 oil pack with gems here)
      5. [**Akashi's Gift:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akashi%27s_Shop#Akashi.27s_Gifts) this is important, you should get all the rewards from Akashi even if you are F2P by just tapping on her twice a day.
  * [Shiranui's shop](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shops) includes: 
      1. Proto-Core shop: quote from the wiki: "Allows you to turn shipgirl blueprints of PR ships which are Developer Level 30 into Prototype Core's to invest into other PR ship blueprints or weapon blueprints." Basically end-game stuffs, PR gives 5 cores each, DR gives 20 cores each. Stocking up on it is good cause you can buy UR gears with these, expensive but better than praying for research.
      2. Core Data shop: Core Data drops from **Hard mode STORY map** *NOT events*, some daily/weekly missions or events. Core Data gears are generally good, refer to the [Core Data Guide](Core%20Data%20Guide.md) for an extensive recommendation.
      3. Merit shop: (a.k.a Gold Bulin shop) Exercise or PvP currency shop, nothing worth much here: the occasional cubes, gold bulins, purple bulins if need be, T4 tech boxes are also nice to kickstart your early-mid game. The 3 ships: Albacore (SS), South Dakota (BB), Eldrige(DD) are all decent, you will eventually get them for your collection but for the early-mid game, you can safely ignore them.
      4. General shop: **some items cost GEMS so read the price tag carefully before you buy,** the main Gold shop. Nothing special to say besides a *personal* general recommendation: Purple Food > Blue Food > Cubes > Red skill books > other skill books = Purple T3 Aux Plates > everything else. Note: I do NOT encourage buying T4 Gold Tech boxes EVER because the value proposition is so low with not only the rate of a gold gear being low but can also land on a useless gold equipment instead. Feel free to disagree, it's your gold after all, the game has a lot of gold sinks (LB, awakening, research, retrofits, enhancing equipment, Meowfficers, construction and this shop), you decide what to dump your gold into, not me.
      5. Event shop: Kinda straight forward, buy what you need with the event currency that you get from daily mission and grinding event maps, here's a *personal* general event shop purchasing guide (do note that you should ask a help chat for your specific situation, this is just for a blanket view because exclusive event gears have always been good or at least niche on one unit): Gold/Oil (during event, their value drops after event ends since you can't convert Oil to event points anymore) > Exclusive Gears > Event Ships if you don't have > Aux and any needed Plates > DR BPs >= PR BPs > (Optional Boxes if lacking specific gears) > Chips/SSR Cat boxes > (Gear Skins /s) > the rest.
      6. Guild shop: Where you spend your guild currency outside of upgrading Guild Tech. **Important note: ALWAYS refresh this shop with the button on the top right as it cost 50 guild coins only.** Recommendation on purchase order: T4 Plates > Premium Food > Gold Retrofits BP if needed > T3 Plates if needed > Everything else (Cat Boxes, Ships, Tech Boxes, etc)

### [Dockyard](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Dockyard) --- Element 20
  
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/BGJKMMF.png)
  - Info: includes your ships stats, skills and overview of equipment:
    * EXP: When the ship reaches level 100/105/110/115, she can be awaken by tapping on the exp bar to further increase her level cap by 5. She can still gain **exp from sorties** into a bank (max 3 million) while being at the level cap. The cost for each awakening is detailed on the wiki.
    * Skills: can be leveled in the [Tactical Classroom in the Academy.](#HQ)
    * Gears: A gear sets button to the far right allows you to save your current gear loadout to quickly unequip/reequip all gears.
    * Bottom part of the UI allow you to: change her Skins, view the ship details in the Archives (to listen to her various unlocked voicelines for example), Lock/Unlock, View the comments on her, Inspect the artwork, set her as Favorite
    * Morale and Affinity is explained [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Affection). But TL;DR is:     
      - Morale range from 0 to 150, normal cap is 119 and can be exceed by placing them in dorms. If a ship have >120 morale at the start of battle, they gain +20% EXP from sorties.
      - Morale regenerates in six-minute intervals. The base rate is 20 points per hour, which can be increased by being married (+10 per hour), being in the first floor of the Dorm (+20 per hour), or the second floor (+30 per hour).
      - Using shipgirls in battle (including daily raid and ambushes) cost 2 morale AT THE START OF BATTLE. Subs do not take any morale cost when called in except Weekly Subs challenge.
      - Sinking in any non-Exercise and non-OpSi sortie reduces morale by 10.
      - Shipgirls in the Lecture Hall will slowly drain morale over time towards 0. Shipgirls with low morale will refuse to go to Lectures.
      - Using shipgirls in battle (except Exercises) raise their Affection by 0.0625 (0.125 if MVP) per battle.
      - Putting her in the Dorm might cause her to display a heart icon. Tapping it will increase her Affection by 0.1 to 0.3 points. Food and existing Affection level may affect the chance of heart icon appearing.
      - Ships set as secretary gain 1 point of Affection every 300-320 minutes. Secretary Affection gain stops at 90 Affection.
      - Oathing increase the affection cap to 200 and if affection at 200, provides +12% instead of +6% on all stats (except luck, speed and accuracy)
  - Gear: all ships have 5 equipment slots, what they can equip on each slot is listed here. 
    - For all vanguard ships, they will have a main gun of their class sometimes they can use a smaller caliber gun, an secondary weapon, be it a torpedo mount or a DD gun depending on their SHIP class (not hull class), an AA gun or in the case of absent of it, a unique gear slot (e.g DB for Shirakami Fubuki) and 2 Auxiliary slots.
    - For BB/BC/BBV/BM they have generally the same slots except their secondary can also be CL gun sometimes, replace the AA for a seaplane for BBV and they all use BB guns.
    - For CVs and CVLs, they have their own plane loadout and their limit break perks complement that, a combination of Fighters, DBs, TBs (and/or AA gun for most CVLs) and 2 Aux slots
    - For ARs, they have 3 Aux slots and 2 AA gun slots.
    - For Subs, they have 2 main Submarine torpedoes, a DD gun (unique CA gun for Surcouf) and 2 aux slots
    - **Efficiency:** This is an often overlooked stat but it directly relates to how much damage an equipment in that slot will do. In layman's term, a slot equipment efficiency is a factor in determining what a ship ideal loadout for a specific situation. For exact damage calculations: refer to the [combat page](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Combat#Damage_Calculations) 
  - Limit Break: detailed in the [Limit Break Guide](Limit%20Break%20Guide.md)
  - Enhance: Quote from the wiki: 
    - This screen allows other ships to be permanently consumed in order to boost the stats of the currently selected ship, up to 12 at a time. 
    - The table at the top shows the current stats available for boosting (Firepower, Torpedo, Aircraft and Reload, depending on the type of weapons the ship is able to use). These bars will fill with EXP from merging ships that give boosts to those stats. This can be done to increase the stats up to their cap (which increases with every level and stops after level 100).
    - Basically, do it often using grey ships as fodders for the ships you are using, it is basically free stats from grey ships that you gain from farming maps.
  - Unique for PR/DR ships: Prototype ships do not have their Limit Break and Enhance page but instead uses their PR/DR BPs to enhance their stats and gain a boost of stats and efficiency at Dev 5/15/25, similar LB perks at Dev 10/20/30. They also have their unique system called Fate Simulation that uses their BPs to further enhance their luck stat and finally enhances their skill at level 5 Fate Simulation.
  -  [Retrofits:](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Dockyard#Retrofit) TL;DR: You spend gold and retrofit BPs obtained from **Hard Mode STORY maps** to retrofit the ships, giving them a slew of stats, slot efficiencies, sometimes the following: a new skill and/or enhance their existing one, changes their equipment slots to other LB perks. Retrofit BPs drop are always based on the map you run and can be crafted from T1 to T2 at a ratio of 6:1.
     - X-1: Destroyer
     - X-2: Cruiser
     - X-3: Battleship
     - X-4: Carrier

### [Depot](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Equipment) --- Element 21
Equipment of all sort goes here split into 3 tabs on the bottom right:
  - **Items:** your storage for food, medals, cubes, quick finishers, tech boxes, plates, skill books retrofit and PR BPs and other commemorative and miscellaneous items. There's an assortment of things in here but there isn't a cap on how much you can store so don't fret on it. **Tip on using Tech boxes:**
    * T1 can be combined to T2 and T2 to T3 at a ratio of 6:1. You cannot craft T4 boxes however.
    * T1 tech boxes have the most gold from dismantling gears so at late game when you don't need purple gears from boxes anymore, just open them as is and scrap the gears for emergency gold.
    * For early game, it is recommended that you combine them to open for potential purple gears. The drop table for each faction tech boxes can be found [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Equipment#Equipment_Box_Contents)
  - [**Gears:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Equipment#Ship_Equipments) has the following feature and recommendation:
    * Gears and Gear Skins: switch on the left hand side.
    * Disassembly (a.k.a scrapping) mode: enter by pressing the disassemble button on the bottom right to mass scrap up to 40 pieces of equipment at a time. A tip here is you can set a secondary password to act as a soft lock to prevent yourself from scrapping already enhanced gears.
    * Click on this button ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZlkaoJz.png) on the bottom right to have a rough understanding of weapon diameters.
    * Toggling the equipped button to see all currently equipped gears as well. 
    * Sort gears on the top right by slots, type, rarity and enhance level
    * Base depot capacity is 300 slots, you can expand it by 20 slots for 100 gems through the [Akashi's Shop](#Shops)
    * Enhance cost can be found on the wiki link
    * Safe to Scrap Guide for Mid-game+ players: [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/User:Thebombzen/Safe_To_Scrap_MK_II)
    * **(1):** reasoning why names should be ignored is Yostars is incredibly lazy in fixing their translation mistake. [Here's an example](https://i.imgur.com/NOenqkF.png) Oh and fyi, it's a PR CA gun, just wrong name because why fix equipment name when you can fix VDiR cutscenes translation instead.
    * **(2):** Enhance cost gold and plates so read up on what you should enhance and not. A +10 main gun has near 300% base damage of the +0 so it's very effective in increasing your ship damage.
  - [**Designs:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Equipment#Design) This is where you craft equipment BPs you get from running maps, researches into full pieces of equipment that you can use. Some Gold gear from research requires 25 BPs and 500 gold instead of the usual 15 BPs, 200 gold.
  
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/0HKBN2c.png)
   
### HQ: --- Element 22
HQ split into 3 portions: Academy, Dormitory and Cat Lodge/Meowfficer.
### **Academy:**
  
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/ifIMStn.jpg)
  * [**Lecture Hall:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Living_Area#Lecture_Hall) The wiki will provide all the information needed so I'll just go over some of the key points:
    1. **Unlocked at HQ/commander level 50** and can be upgraded every 5 levels after.
    2. Only MLB level 100+ ships can generate proficiency from EXP FROM SORTIES (basically anything that cost oil to fight).
    3. Lecture runs for 12 hours. 
    4. The consumed XP is calculated at the time the lecture is claimed. This means that even if you start the lecture with little XP in the bar but earn XP while the lecture is ongoing, that XP will be consumed and given to the ships in the lecture.
    5. Ships in the Dorm cannot participate in Lectures. Lectures do not prevent participation in any other activities (like sorties or commissions).
    6. Lectures drain morale slowly to 0. Ships with low morale cannot participate.
      
  * [**Tactical Class:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Living_Area#Tactical_Class) a.k.a Skill training. You start with 2 slots and can unlock the 3rd slot with 500 gems. Using proper skill books for the skill gives a +50% exp. **Tips on skill training and skill books:**
    - *Note: All vanguard ships except for collab also have their own AOA that are part of their limit break perks and can't be leveled here*
    - When starting out, level skills to level 6-7 across the board according to priorities such as
      1. **Surface healing skills on these following ships if you use them and should: Shouhou, Unicorn, Ryuuhou, Arizona:** while the answer to clearing map is always damage but these heals are very substantial in keeping your vanguard in mobbing fleet not die an untimely death before the boss spawn especially in the early game when you have a severe lack of usable defensive Aux. While you normally won't use more than 1 healer in both of your fleet combined, it is always helpful to have options.
      2. Afterwards, it's **DAMAGE FIRST**, basically anything that boost a ship or the team's total damage output should be prioritised in the following order: 
        * Battleship Barrage: Ah yes, flashy danmaku is the name of the game after all, these barrages from BBs and BCs alike are "for the most part" very strong and should be leveled accordingly.
        * Personal damage boost: Mostly are red skills, the most abundant of the type. Some are very strong to be borderline damage potential of top tier barrages such as Enterprise only skill. Unique barrages such as starter's retrofit skill also come with their hefty buff and are very worth it. Some exceptions of course exist that you are better off leaving at level 1 (e.g Portland).
        * Team wide buffs: Stat buffs, straight damage buffs or damage amplifications while varies from good to outright broken, they are dependent on multiple factors and therefore a bit more tricky to ultilize to their maximum potential. Therefore, personally, I'll recommend to prioritize them less.
      3. Defensive skills: There are many good ones I can list off but defensive skills by itself are rarer and those that focuses too much on it in returns does less damage. **Turtling doesn't clear maps, damage does.** On some cases, you can outright ignore them till much later. 
    - Proceed to level skills you deem important (BB/BC Barrages amongst others) to 10 before moving on to the next ship
    - Skill books recommendation:
      1. When you start out (a.k.a below HQ 70), skill books are harder to get. Therefore having something leveling is better than not. 
      2. You can use blue skill books to level red skills, it is perfectly fine, you have generally more red skills to level than blue skills most of the time anyways.
      3. When you start having a surplus of T1 books, it is recommended to combine them because opportunity cost, time cost and for convenience sake. Personally I haven't used a T1 book ever since HQ 75 because I'd rather use a T2 blue book instead of micro-manage using 2 T1 red books for the same amount of exp.
  * [**Cattery:**](#cat-lodge) Meowfficers room. Refers to the Cat Lodge section below 

  * [**Canteen and Merchant:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Living_Area#Canteen_and_Merchant) This is your passive oil and gold income respectively:
     - Unlocked at the start and can be upgraded **every 10 HQ levels** starting from Level 3.
     - The resource generation rate and storage cap limit are dependent on the building's level. 
     - Always upgrade this asap, it's really really good, free stuff is free.
  
  * [**Medallion:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Medallion) Flex tapes and showcase trophies for your profile, nothing more to be said, it's cosmetics and has challenges if you want to complete them.
  
  * [**Munition:**](#Shops) refers back to the Shiranui's Shop above.
  
### [**Dorm:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Living_Area#Dorm) 
Seriously though, I can't TL;DR more on this section, you have to read the wiki, it's just that complicated if you want to optimize exp/oil ratio and other things:
  * **Decorations do not have to be put down to increase your comfort.**
  * Dorm slots is recommended to spend your gems on even as a F2P as permanent upgrades, the 6th slot is debatable but still very valuable should you able to afford it.
  * Floor 1 restores a bonus 20 morale per hour while floor 2 is 30 morale per hour and both floor can exceed the normal cap of 119 morale to get EXP bonus.
  * Quote from the wiki of the recommended build order (reasoning and mathwork on the wiki):
    - The first expansion due to its favorable ratio of Comfort per Furniture coin.
    - High-Comfort limited event items, as this will increase the maximum achievable Comfort beyond what is possible by permanently available items alone. Also grab anything that is aesthetically pleasing to you.
    - As many 2-Comfort items as will fit. This should take you to 100 Comfort or so.
    - The remaining expansions.
    - Whatever you feel like; due to diminishing returns it will make little difference at this point.
  * EXP per hour formula where the **Modifier** changed based on the number of shipgirls in dorm:
    - 1 girl is 1
    - 2 girls is 0.9
    - 3 girls is 0.8
    - 4 girls is 0.7
    - 5 girls is 0.64
    - 6 girls is 0.56(6)

### [**Cat Lodge**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Meowfficer)
There's a lot of information here but the gains is really minimal for the amount of gold you need to sink in
   - **Unlocked at HQ level 40** and does not require upgrading
   - My recommendation is do your daily/weekly box opening and buy the free box everyday. Wait till you get a good starting cat (preferably an SSR cat or Edelweiss) to decide to reroll its talent. 
   - You are mainly looking for these top talents: **Mountain, Flame, Ace Pilot for CV focus, Soulful Warrior for BB focus, Forest and Miracle are good Acc/Evasion talents.
   - Save dupes of SSR and Edelweiss just in case you find a great starting cat.
   - Since good cats are rare to come by, most cats you have early on are just fodders, use them to bank up exp for a later ideal cat that you'll reroll.
   - You can go a step further and use the Talent calculator made by Bluerendar#2640 which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NcqTZTgU5hF6VB7ziIHiIxQrSKTa4g77stPr4ApzRjw/edit?usp=sharing). 
   - A short guide to cat position as well as their ship type (note: the cats that isn't included means they function on both slots and have different and specific requirements for their skills) can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/IkPVDlW.jpg)
   - A short-hand Talent Tierlist (contentious but still good mostly Forest and Miracle by itself is T0.5) can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/OMn80m5.png)
   - Cat Dorm (New Addition): Always put your main cats (or potential fodders) here as they get free exp overtime. Also go to your Cat Lodge everyday to do the 3 activities to upgrade this Cat Dorm.

### Lab --- Element 23
This is the research and development department. **Unlocked at HQ leve 30** and is split into 3 parts:

### [Fleet Technology](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fleet_Technology)
TL;DR: 
  * Fleet Tech gives bonus stats for **Maximum Limit Broken ships** based on their hull type. 
  * These stat bonuses are gained from getting unique ships to level 120 and Faction Tech. 
  * The 4 main faction tech gives stats for **ALL ships regardless of their faction** and upgradable when you get the tech point for that faction (gained from collecting new unique ships, MLB them and getting them to level 120)
  * **ALSO REQUIRED FOR UNLOCKING PR SHIPS FROM SEASON 2 ONWARDS IN SHIPYARD**
  
### [Research Academy](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Research_Academy)
A.k.a A MASSSIVE GOLD SINK AGANE.
  - Simply put, you spend time and sometimes resources to get PR EQ BP and PR BPs from the 5 projects. It takes a while before getting the gears or to max out (dev30, then fate 5) PR ships so don't worry about rushing it. ~~About 9 to 15 months for a DR ship or gear cause RNG is fun~~
  - The rates are not equal so here's crowd-sourced data sheets for your perusal: [PR1 speadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r0himICsu0p_DcEPQYoMqv6V7bbtyZzhyX38SHpQZ3g/edit), [PR2 spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12jp_v9PbojRG2PQ1SMr4y-uQASyKz_ewj-Fi4NVpjls/edit), [PR3 spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FCTYKLXjxgCpMEuKKVGTZg89DBZ1G9kuct26F1fTZ3k/edit?usp=drivesdk). You can also find this in the readme file of the folder. Best bookmark it, it's very helpful.
  - You can change the focus of the research to guaranteed 2 out of 5 project are from the season you need.
  - You can refresh the list of 5 projects ONCE a day. Reset at exactly the daily reset.
  - Do **NOT** worry about rushing researches or getting the most value at the start because gold is always in demand and T3 plates are needed for enhancing your gears so ration them properly.
  - PR catch up mechanics: Choose a ship to get that ship catch BPs, you get 300 BPs TOTAL so you can't just get 300 BPs per ship, ration them properly.
  - DR catch up mechanics: You can get 150 DR BP PER DR ship. There's no rush to this.
  - PR1 catch up mechanics: You can use Gold in place of PR Ship BPs for PR1 ships (eventually PR2 and later). The cost for enhancement is heavily discounted for a number of enhancement everyday (1st 2 are free).
  
### [Shipyard](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Research)
TL;DR: MORE GRIND POGGERS
  - A TL;DR half in joke but actually serious, you spend oil using specific ships that in the required faction and hull class to get exp, spend a bunch more resources before you even get a new ship that will perform worse than whatever you have because you can't limit break them like normal ships. 
  - On the upside tho, they are for the most part good WHEN MAXED OUT. Check [Wis Ship tier guide](https://github.com/YourWaifuIsShip/Azur-Lane-Guides/blob/master/AL%20Tier%20Guide.md) to know which to go for 1st.
  - You can change your development to a new ship after 24 hours which **pauses the quests of the previous one**. Finishing a development will **NOT** reset this 24 hrs cooldown.
  - Sorties EXP means any fight that cost oil (PvP, comms, dorm, lecture don't count, daily raid does)

### [Missions](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Task) --- Element 24
TL;DR: Skinner Box 101. You do stuffs here and get resources and rewards. Reset at daily reset and weekly reset.
  - Event usually comes with 3 extra daily missions that rewards event currency:
    * Build 3 ships
    * Sortie 15 times
    * Do Hard Mode 1 time
  - Weekly Missions are a bit more straight forward, you can rush it all out in a day.
    
### [Building](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Building) --- Element 25
TL;DR: Gacha zone and retirement department. You spend cubes and gold to gacha for ships here, retire blue rarity and higher ships for medals and exchange the medals for bulins, ships, PR BPs, Plates, Books, Food, etc.

### [Permanent Build](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Building#Permanent_Construction):
  * As a newbie it might be hard to decide on which pool you should do your daily on. **If there's an event banner going on, always roll on it unless you lucked out all the banner ship already.** Other than that, I'd recommend build on Light to save cubes **if you are happy with your current fleet comp** or know there's a rerun event or a new event coming soon that has good progression ships, reasoning being:
    * Light is the cheapest 600 gold 1 cube per build and the daily/weekly will refund the cost completely. It however does not have many notable build-only ships: Mogami, Yukikaze, Sirius, Swiftsure, Montpelier are the main draws. The other notable ones can also be obtained from maps or [Medal Exchange](#medal-exchange) such as: Laffey, Z23 (Niimi), San Diego (Sandy), Portland, Phoenix amongst others.
    * Heavy cost 1500 gold and 2 cubes per build (as much as a normal event banner) but has most of the progression friendly ship in the game BBs, BCs and CAs including but not limited to: Minneapolis (Minne), Hood, Duke of York (Dork), North Carolina (Norcal), Washington, ~~Jean Bart (JB), Tirpitz,~~ Hyuuga, Pennsylvania, Arizona. The last 2 is easily obtainable from 2-2, Hood and Hyuuga from [Medal Exchange](#medal-exchange) as well. BBs are so highly valued because of their strong shelling prowess that even the worst of them can still put up a half decent performance.
    * Special also cost 1500 gold and 2 cubes per build but with a focus on CVs and Subs instead. Submarines are mid to end-game concerns because getting the gears for them is for a lack of a better term: a pain in the ass (**DO** get transitional gears for them to do the weekly subs though, it will help you farm less SoS maps). CVs, while not lacking behind in the damage department (except on some bosses) and is relatively easier to gear, lack an Aux gun to properly defend themselves from jihads forces you to field better vanguard to intercept for them in a mobbing fleet and they requires more upgraded equipment and MLB perks to reach their full damage potential whereas BBs can function just fine with just LB1. Nevertheless there are still notable CVs here that can more than enough carry your early game: Essex, Enterprise, Centaur, Taihou, Shangri-La. Enterprise is also in [Medal Exchange](#medal-exchange)

### [Medal Exchange](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Building#Exchange)
This is a shop in and of itself and *the shop content is the same for all players in the same server* so a purchasing recommendation is in order:
  * Buy the SSR ship on the fortnightly cycle if you want/need her (Hood and Enterprise are massive here)
  * **ALWAYS save at least 80 medals to buy the gold bulins**
  * Items tab: Gem only food = T3 Skill books > any T3 plates you need > PR BPs > Retro and T2 plates.
  * Proceed to buy the purins should you need them
  * I'd only buy a couple Submarine Tech Boxes to get some gears if you are that desperate for them (hint: you really don't, a highly leveled DD with the default starter gears that was handed to you can easily solo the entire SoS map until at least W5 if not W9 including the boss for the foreseeable future)
  
### [Retire](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Building#Retire)
Here you can retire ships for medals, some return of gold and oil based on level and hull class as well (it allows for an infinite farm of a particular map but I would not recommend anyone to subject themselves to such a brainless activity). On the Medal side:
  * Grey (N) gives 0 medal so use them as enhancement fodders instead.
  * Blue (R) gives 1 medal each.
  * Purple (SR) gives 4 medals each.
  * Gold (SSR) gives 10 medals each.
  * Rainbow (UR) gives 30 medals each (Sandykai, Warkai, Shinano, New Jersey, etc.)

### Wishing Well (EVENT)
Normally I don't say about event but this one is special:
  * You can choose 2 ships from any of the 3 Permanent Build pools (after a specific cut off date) to get their rate up. 
  * This selection is **NOT** kept between wishing well and you will choose new wishes every wishing well event (sounds obvious but I have had people asked this before) because the wishing well is constantly expanded since new ships are also being introduced as well. 
  * Since this event is rare (1-3 times a year), I can only say you should pick waifu ships or ships you don't have for rate up ~~(not that it matters, rate up is a lie in all gacha and this game is no exception)~~

### [Guild](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fleet) --- Element 26
Basics: Creating a guild cost 300 gems, changing the guild name cost 100 gems. You don't have to join a guild since Public Guild is a thing but it is recommended to join for Guild Operations and a faster Guild Tech upgrades. Now onto the meaty gritty:
  * Guild Contribution, Missions and Supplies:
    - Contribute: 3 times a day for Guild Coins and contribute "Progress" to Guild Tech.
    - Missions: Once a week rewards 300 Guild Coins. Doing more just helps Guild Tech and doesn't reward Guild Coins.
    - Supplies: Bought by Officers and Leaders. 14 days Supply for everyone, gives Guild Coins and other things.
  * Guild Technology:
    - Expand Gold storage: increase Gold soft cap for all guild members.
    - Expand Fuel storage: increase Fuel soft cap for all guild members.
    - Expand dock slots: increase dock slots for all guild members.
    - Expand equip storage: increase equip storage slots for all guild members.
    - Cat Box Discount: Self-explanatory.
  * Guild Operations:
    - Twice a month joining cap: Split into 2 Parts.
    - Part 1 (Operations): TL;DR: Click on Event, press Recommend and Confirm and wait. You need to send out at least 1 "fleet" to get the operation rewards so be sure to log on at least once a day to do that. Hint: it gives a lot of Guild Coins
    - Part 2 (Guild Boss): TL;DR: Use your strongest combat fleet to do damage to the boss once a day. You need to finish the fight once to get the rewards. The more often and higher you score, the faster it dies.

## Sortie (Element 15):
Split into: [Main Campaign](#Main-Campaign), [Event Banner](#Event-Banner), [Operation Siren](Operation%20Siren%20Guide.md), [Challenge Mode](Challenge-Mode), [Daily Challenges](#Daily-Challenges), [Commission]() and [Exercise]().

## Main Campaign:
Has a Normal Mode, a Hard Mode and SoS Maps.
  * Normal Mode:
    - Nothing much to say besides, this is where you will farm for most of the game.
    - Here's a [Chapter Walkthrough Guide](https://slaimuda.github.io/ectl/#/newbguide)
  * Hard Mode:
    - Unlocks when you 3* all of the corresponding chapter's maps (X-1 to X-4)
    - Has a fleet requirement. Needs to have ONE of each required Main FLeet and Vanguard ship to make the fleet a valid fleet to sortie (and contribute to the stat req).
    - Has a stat requirement: Meet the stats to sortie your fleet.
    - Rewards: Retrofits Blueprints and Core Data.
  * SoS Maps: (X-5 Maps, 3-5 to 10-5)
    - Unlocks when you clear 3-4. Signal strength depends on the highest X-5 map you have done, max is 8 when you clear 9-5. Drop table improves with Signal Strength.
    - Boss is always a submarine so be sure to have DDs and CLs on your boss fleet to kill them before losing S rank.
    - Higher maps don't necessary have a better drop table with the sole exception of 10-5 which doesn't drop grey gears. On the contrary, 3-5 has only 3 fight before boss spawn and is really easy.
 
## Event Banner:
Usually events have their own maps with Normal Mode (has 3x currency 1st clear daily), Hard Mode (has 2x currency 1st clear daily **ON RERUN EVENTS**), SP map (drop 800 currency daily), EX map (Bullet Hell flex map).

## Operation Siren:
Please refer to the Operation Siren Guide [here](Operation%20Siren%20Guide.md)

## Challenge Mode:
3 months cycle semi-EX mode that gives a unique frame.

## Daily Challenges:
The [wiki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Daily_Raid) sums this up really nicely but TL;DR:
  * The main 3 (Escort Mission, Advance Mission, Fierce Assault) gives a lot of gold.
  * Once you S rank a given raid, you will have the option to skip 1 or all attempts, getting items and gold you'd normally get per run but spending no oil or time. Only downsides to this are: No experience, not counting towards "enemy shot down" tasks, and no possible affection gain.
  * Schedule is as followed: ![](https://i.imgur.com/SlejfXD.png)
