# Core Data Guide
This guide is meant to serve as a reference point for making purchases from the [Core Data Exchange](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shops#Core_Exchange). Core data is one of the primary sources of end-game equipment, and is acquired primarily as a reward for completing daily hardmode maps. As such, it's imperative that you always complete your daily hardmodes. Please note that **Core Data that hasn't been spend until the end of the month WILL carry over to the next month**, so spending all core data at the end of the month is not neccassary. Hard mode, while being called hard, isn't actually much harder. It is still the same map and drop table but with a fleet requirement and higher level enemies. 

Equipment is listed in equipment stock order and not grouped by purchase priority. Please exercise critical thinking on what equipment best fit your situation to inform your purchase.

For more detailed information, see the [Equipment Guide](Equipment%20Guide.md) and [Auxiliary Guide](Auxiliary%20Guide.md).

## Purchasable Ships and Other Luxuries
In general, core data is best saved for guaranteed equipment, as that equipment is often incredibly strong and cannot be acquired anywhere else. **The ships found in the core data shop can be acquired through farming maps in the war archives.** While they cannot be readily acquired from other sources, the tech level 5 equipment packs represent a poor value proposition, given that they're still beholden to the same equipment pools as any other equipment pack, with many of the available gold pieces being either completely useless or outclassed by research or core data equipment.

Cognition chips are a well-justified value proposition. Their core data cost is relatively low relative to the quantity of chips acquired. However, the actual applicability of cognition chips is going to be a very personal issue, and purchasing chips is likely only worthwhile for the most dedicated players.

## Recommended Primary Equipment

[![Seiran](/resources/seiran%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Aichi_M6A_Seiran)

 - **[Quadruple 380mm Mle1935](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Quadruple_380mm_(Mle_1935)#Type_3)** | Purchase if you use Jean Bart, whose skill synergies with this gun allow her to make the best use of it.
 - **[Prototype 203mm Twin No.3](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_203mm_(3rd_Year_Type_No._3_Prototype))** - While arguably obsoleted by the research 203mm Mle1934, the No.3 is still worth buying, especially as a newer player, given the relative boost in power it provides relative to its ease of acquisition. *Now craftable in the Gear Lab, consider spending your cores on other guns.
 - **[VF-17 Corsair](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Vought_F4U_Corsair_(VF-17_Squadron))** - The fastest 2x 500lb gold fighter in the game with unique T0 bombs that do more damage than T3 500lb bombs. While its AA gun suite is fairly lacklustre, it makes up for that with its fleet wide AA boost.
 - **[Fairey Firefly](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fairey_Firefly)** - A relatively fast dive bomber with exceptionally strong anti-air guns. Has niche usage when airstrike AA and/or faster airstrike reload speed is desired.
 - **[Fairey Swordfish (818 Squadron)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fairey_Swordfish_(818_Squadron))** - The most generally useful parallel spread torpedo bomber. Its utility makes it a generally superior option to the relatively more difficult to acquire Fairey Barracuda or VT-18 TBM Avenger when using a Ryuusei or Tenzan would be impractical. Also used in PvP.
 - **[Seiran](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Aichi_M6A_Seiran)** - Purchase if you use I-13 - the Seiran's damage output increases by 60% when used by a SSV.

## Recommended Auxiliary Equipment
[![Type 93 Oxygen Torpedo](/resources/oxytorp%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Type_93_Pure_Oxygen_Torpedo)
[![Type 1 AP Shell](/resources/t1%20shell%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Type_1_Armor_Piercing_Shell)
[![SHS](/resources/sh%20shell%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Super_Heavy_Shell)

[![Homing Beacon](/resources/homing%20beacon%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Homing_Beacon)
[![Pressure-Resistant Hull Design](/resources/Sub%20Hull%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Pressure-Resistant_Hull_Design)
[![FuMO 25](/resources/FuMO.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Funkmess-Ortung_25_Radar)

 - **[Type 93 Oxygen Torpedo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Type_93_Pure_Oxygen_Torpedo)** - The strongest offensive aux for nearly every vanguard unit equipped with torpedoes. Its high-rarity makes upgrading it relatively difficult and as such, treat it as a long-term commitment. Long-term oxytorp goals are 4 or so for vanguard usage and between 3-6 for submarine fleets.
 - **[Type 1 Armour-Piercing Shell](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Type_1_Armor_Piercing_Shell)** - The strongest offensive aux combo for main fleet artillery support is a T1 shell alongside a SHS. Given the existence of other especially useful auxiliary equips for these ships, T1 shell represents a weaker value prospect than SH shells and can be subsitute for a T91 purple shell from IJN T3/T4 boxes for a while.
 - **[Super-Heavy Shell](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Super_Heavy_Shell)** - The strongest offensive aux for main fleet artillery support. Equipping one on every battleship in current use should be considered a default. Purchase accordingly.
 - **[Improved Snorkel](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Improved_Snorkel)** - A strong offensive aux for calling submarines into combat. Its usefulness will depend on the submarines you're using and the torpedoes they're equipped with. Purchase only if you already understand submarine mechanics and purchase no more than 3.
 - **[Seal of the Four Gods](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Seal_of_the_Four_Gods)** - Boosts main gun and barrage damage when equipped to the An Shan class DDs. Given their weak torpedoes, this auxiliary equip easily overtakes the oxytorp as the strongest offensive aux for them specifically. Obviously required for them but other perk of this auxiliary equipment is that it provides 550 hp to DDs. Therefore that makes it better than a second toolbox for DDs that might benefit from a double toolbox setup since the heal doesn't stack.
 - **[Homing Beacon](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Homing_Beacon)** - Incredibly useful aux for carriers. Should be considered default equipment for trash clearing fleets, PVP and reload tuning carriers. Purchase accordingly.
  - **[Pressure-Resistant Hull Design](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Pressure-Resistant_Hull_Design)** - A deceptively useful offensive aux for calling submarines into combat as its effects make firing slower torpedo types accurately easier for the side subs.
  - **[FuMO 25](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Funkmess-Ortung_25_Radar)** - A better Fire Control Radar (FCR) that's also equippable by Light Cruisers, giving them access to a sorely needed FP boosting aux. Owing to that very same CL FP boosting niche, this item has the lowest priority among all other auxes on this list. 

## Questionable Equipment
[![Seafury](/resources/Seafury%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hawker_Sea_Fury)
[![SBD Dauntless (McClusky)](/resources/dauntless%20mcclusky%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Douglas_SBD_Dauntless_(McClusky))
[![Barracuda (831 Squadron)](/resources/barracuda%20831%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fairey_Barracuda_(831_Squadron))
[![Blackburn Firebrand](/resources/Firebrand%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Blackburn_Firebrand)
[![Ocean Soul Camo](/resources/ocean%20soul%20camo%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ocean_Soul_Camouflage)
[![100/150 AV Gas](/resources/av%20gas%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/100/150_Aviation_Gasoline)
[![Type 98 FDD](/resources/t98%20fdd%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Type_98_Delayed_Firing_Device)
[![TBM Avenger (ASW)](/resources/tbm%20avenger%20asw%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/General_Motors_TBM-3_Avenger_(ASW))
 - **[Seafury](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hawker_Sea_Fury)** - Think F6F Hellcat but with a slightly less dps AA gun (roughly same burst AA) but a slightly faster reload. While it's clearly a good equipment, it is also be easily replaced with a more easily obtainable Hellcat or a VF-17 which cost the same in the shop.
 - **[SBD Dauntless (McClusky)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Douglas_SBD_Dauntless_(McClusky))** - While the base damage is laughably low compared to a more damage-focused bomber like the SB2C Helldiver, the damage buff against carriers itself applies to the ship equipped with the plane rather than just the plane itself.
 - **[Fairey Barracuda (831 Squadron)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fairey_Barracuda_(831_Squadron))** - What if you took a Suisei, made it deal half damage, and gave its bombs an abysmally low 24% chance to inflict a debuff that increases all gunnery damage dealt to the target by 8% for 6s. While almost entirely useless for PVE, it happens to deal the same base crash damage as the torpedo bomber Barracuda, making it useful for PVP.
 - **[Firebrand](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Blackburn_Firebrand)** - Think Fairey Barracuda but with a much slower reload (1.3s) but a slightly better AA gun.
 - **[Ocean Soul Camo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ocean_Soul_Camouflage)** - While technically stronger than blue rarity naval camo, it's by a very minor amount, while being more expensive to invest in thanks to its rarity and status as core data equipment. New players will want to spend their data and upgrade plates on stronger equipment, while veterans likely have enough improved rudders to not need this item's minor stat boosts.
 - **[100/150 Aviation Gas](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/100/150_Aviation_Gasoline)** - Only useful in PvP.
 - **[Type 98 Firing Delay Device](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Type_98_Delayed_Firing_Device)** - Reduces spread of the main gun by a negligible amount. Has potential to improve clear consistency and therefore average clear time in incredibly select scenarios, but is typically going to be less useful than a different offensive aux.
 - **[TBM-3 Avenger (ASW)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/General_Motors_TBM-3_Avenger_(ASW))** - Incredibly strong anti-submarine weapon. Is equipped in the auxiliary slot of light carriers, not a standard plane slot. Given the relative ease of ASW fights, it's an unnecessary purchase. Treat as a luxury.

## Bad Equipment
[![Improved Storage Battery](/resources/battery%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Improved_Storage_Battery)
[![F2A Buffalo (Thach)](/resources/f2a%20buffalo%20thach%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Brewster_F2A_Buffalo_(Thach_Squadron))

[![T94 HA Director](/resources/t94%20director%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Type_94_High_Angle_Director)
 - **[Improved Storage Battery](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Improved_Storage_Battery)** - Wholly obsoleted by Meowficers, while also occupying a valuable submarine auxiliary slot.
 - **[Brewster F2A Buffalo (Thach Squadron)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Brewster_F2A_Buffalo_(Thach_Squadron))** - No bombs, below-average aa guns, slower than the Me-155A. Its skill effect fails to make up for its downsides.
 - **[XF5F Skyrocket](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Grumman_XF5F_Skyrocket)** - It go sanic fast.
 - **[Type 94 High-Angle Director](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Type_94_High_Angle_Director)** - Only good for cooking rice.
