# Operation Siren Guide

A new game mode different to the usual stage formats found in the game's story (World) and event stages, Operation Siren (OpSi) is the newest addition to Azur Lane in terms of gameplay content. This is a basic guide for players who've skimmed through the tutorial along with some advise and answers that the playerbase has collectively gained with time since the game mode's implementation.

The Azur Lane EN Wiki has a [dedicated OpSi page](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Operation_Siren) that you should also be reading. It contains information that will be helpful to both new players and those familiar with OpSi mechanics.

## FAQ and Tips:
- **READ THE TUTORIAL**. A lot of questions are answered in the tutorial, remember it, the game won't repeat it. 
- **__PAY ATTENTION WHEN SETTING UP YOUR 1<sup>st</sup> 2 FLEETS__**. Use your **strongest** ships AND meowfficers, initial equipment doesn't matter. You can change gear on any ship anytime when they're deployed within OpSi.  The generally ideal fleet for clearing generic nodes in OpSi would use ships with preloads (i.e. Richelieu, Jean Bart, Perseus) with tanky, high gun damage capable CA(s) in the vanguard. This fleet will be with you until you unlock the ability to sortie 4 fleets simultaneously in OpSi, which comes upon completing Chapter 1. This ties into the next point below.
- **__COMPLETE THE OPSI STORY UNTIL YOU UNLOCK 4 FLEETS__**. This fleet change is mandatory if you want to exit the port, and where your 1<sup>st</sup> free fleet change comes in. Normally, changing fleets and meowfficers with the Fleet Deployment Order costs a lot of AP - up to 100 AP if used immediately after. The cost of this order is reduced down to 0 over time but it takes 24 hours to do so. It is recommended to have 2 specialised fleets - Fleets 2, 3 and 4 should be *specialised* in 1 of 3 damage types (Shelling/Torpedoes/Aviation) to counter Sirens and Promoted Pawns with specific damage debuffs. For example, a fleet filled with 3 BBs, a fleet with 3 CVs and another with 3 Vanguard ships capable of high torpedo damage.
- **"Everything is so confusing, what do?"** - This is permanent content for the most part (META ships are seasonal). Don't worry too much. It will take a lot of consistent playtime to become familiar with the mechanisms and enemies. Just spend your AP where you can - AP has a soft cap of 200 and regenerates at a rate of 1 point per 10 mins.
- **Do the story missions. Seriously, I'm not joking. Do it, a lot of content is gated behind clearing the story missions.** The story markers are the **red exclamation marks** on the map. Story regions reward a lot of adaptive stats, allowing you to fight on and above par even against higher level enemies in OpSi. If you are not end-game or messed up your initial fleet set up, don't stray from the path highlighted by the story markers since high AP entry maps are hard, similar to W12/W13 on Lethal. When you reach the end of Chapter 1 and the game asks you to clear some more regions, do only low star regions if your fleets aren't strong (the higher the Corrosion Level/AP cost, the more difficult the region). Moreover, completing story chapters unlocks Daily Missions and Siren Strongholds.
- **Restart (A.K.A leaving and retrying) battles liberally.** There's no morale or oil cost, meaning that there's no downside to retrying fights. If you missed your preloaded torpedoes on a difficult BB boss and it nearly burns your flagship down, or your vanguard ships start sinking during an Abyssal Zone fight, just restart before your flagship or vanguard sink entirely. Better to live to try again than to sink and have damaged ships you can't make use of.
- **"How do I get out of a region once I've finished clearing it?"** - Click anywhere outside of the map grid to go to the overworld map view. (The back button is a quick way to get to the overworld map view but won't exit your fleets from the current region.)
- **"How do I change my fleet compositions and meowfficers?"** - You will need to go to Order (on the radar on the right of the screen) -> Fleet Redeployment to change your fleet and meoiwfficers. **You may only do so when your fleets are within an Allied (BLUE) Port.**
- **"What to buy with Supply Coins, Supply Tokens and Energy Storage Devices?"** - Refer to the [Shop Guide](#Shop-Guide). But TL;DR: Buying anything that costs coins (the yellow currency) is mostly fine. Buy adaptive tuning samples if you are below 188/188/144. Only buy Gold and Rainbow Plates, Gear Designs and Coordinates with Supply Tokens (purple currency). Coins and Tokens will be exchanged for exchange shop vouchers on the 1<sup>st</sup> of every month. **This monthly reset will also reset your Adaptation stat gains, but star rewards for each region will be kept constant.**
- **"Is {current META ship} permanent?"** - No, she is not. Every META ship has a seasonal time period of about 90 days, at which point she will be replaced by another META ship. The devs have mentioned that every META ship will eventually be made permanently obtainable in some form, but we don't know when or how. 
- **"I'm not getting any EXP in OpSi, what gives?"** - Nodes in story regions and reinforcement (blue) enemy nodes give no EXP except for bosses (sometimes), and fights in OpSi do not cause any Morale or Affection changes as well. After clearing the story regions, the game will force you to enter and clear the region it was based on normally. This has an appropriate AP cost so don't be alarmed when you run out of AP and the game keeps asking you to refill.
- **"What do the icons on bosses here mean, why does the game keep showing me a warning screen?"** - That warning screen just means you are fighting a boss fleet, it's a typical one but do take note of the buffs they get (A -50% shelling damage taken buff for the enemy means you will need torpedoes or planes to do effective damage to the boss, for example). Do be careful if the warning page shows that the enemy has an advantage in the first two adaptive stats - they'll hit MUCH harder while being insanely tanky.
- **"AP Refill with Oil? Should I do that?"** -  The Oil:AP ratio is 10:1. You can refill up to 5 times a **WEEK**. Cost per refill requires 1000/1000/2000/2000/4000 oil in that order. You can also buy AP packs in port/Akashi shops with Supply Coins which effectively removes the need to refill with oil.
- **"What is Meta Lab?"** - It's detailed in the [META Lab/Ashes Showdown section](#Ashes-showdown)
- **"Why are Corruption 5 and 6 regions so hard?"** -  Likely because your current adaptive stats are low. Your adaptive stats will be compared to the enemy's -  every point difference is roughly 1% in your or the enemy's favour (Offense and Defense ranges from 70% - 130%, Tactics (healing) is 70% -100%). The recommended end-game stat line is 188/188/144. You will not gain any additional advantage against even the strongest enemies beyond those values.
- **"What are star rewards? What are the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> star requirements for this region, why are they all marked as '???' ?"** -  Because they are hidden requirements and sometimes dependent on RNG based events to boot. They'll eventually show when you repeatedly complete the region. The wiki has a section for starring requirements and rewards which you can search by name [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Operation_Siren_Exploration)
- **"What should I do after finishing story?"** - Do at least one Stronghold when your adaptive stat is up to snuff to go below stronghold cap even if you have to strugglebus through it. Refer to the [Stronghold Guide](#Stronghold) below. Simply put, you can go to port mid-stronghold and your progress will be saved. Do your daily port missions, strongholds, Abyss, treasure maps and clear all regions in that order.

## General Gameplay:
- There's 3 important things 1st: 
   - Fleet swapping is bottom left now cause you will eventually get access to up to 4 fleet simultanously. 
   - Order tab: on the radar on the right side of the screen. Change fleet, resting to heal up and remove fatigue, recon, submarine call-ins all cost AP. Change fleet cost up to 99 AP, slowly drain to 0 over 24 hrs. Rest cost a static 50 and has a cooldown of 24 hrs as well. Recon cost up to 9 AP drain to 0 over 10-15 mins. Submarine support cost up to 39 AP and reset to 0 over 30 mins.
   - Scanning mode: clunky toggle but crucial to locate hidden cache and scan loot tiles. More details will be given in the Tile section below.
- Sinking: any sunk ships will be revived with 10% of their hp and given the "damaged" debuff (red wrench icon on the hp bar). This disables **ALL** skills and can only be removed by using the Regroup and Rest and Fleet Redeployment in the "Navigational Order" tab or repairing your ships at a port. __Healing a ship to full with repairkits will not remove the debuff.__
- Losing in combat: Most major boss fights (Abyss and Stronghold) are multi-staged, meaning the damage you dealt will remains. When a fleet lose in combat (via timing out or flag ship sinking or all vanguard dies), it is given the "Low Resolve X" debuff (can stack up to 3 times) indicated by a triangle (the more broken it is the stronger the debuff effect. Low resolve lowers FP, TRP, ASW, AVI, AA and EVA by 10% per stack. Low Resolve can be removed by winning battles (if done by other fleet it still counts) or using the Regroup and Rest and Fleet Deploy Navigational Orders. (Crucial for Abyss fights if your fleet is struggling)
- Change fleet and cats by going to Order (on the Radar to the right) then Fleet Redeployment.
- Don't be afraid of retreating or restarting, you don't have morale or oil cost to worry about, restart as much as you want to get the outcome that you want. Also **AVOID** ship sinking in Abyssal Zone cause you cannot recover from the "Damaged" debuff without using Rest and Regroup lest you want to give up on the boss.

#### Adaptability Stat:
- Offense, Survivability, Tactic Adaptability all either buff or debuff the enemy depends on the enemy's count and your own. Shown on the top right in region maps above your cats and fleet buffs OR to the right of the overworld map.
- Increase it with Tuning Samples (they are perma until every other cycle reset so just use them as you get them) or Adaptability modules (Hexagon on maps) collected in the map.
- The difference will make up the modifier with Offense affect the enemy's damage dealt, Survivability affect their hp and Tactics affect YOUR fleet healing capability. With Offense and Survivability ranging from 70%-130% and Tactics (healing) is 70-100% so you can have your Tactics stat below the other 2 by a margin of 30-50 points. 
- C4 and C5 abyssal zones only have 60 and then 90 adaptive stat, with C6 Abyss level 120 boss with 120 stat. 
- Stronghold have around 140-144 adaptive stats.
- To max out on your adaptive stat advantage you need ~195 of Offense and Survival with Tactic at 140-150 but the simpler advice is **aim 200/200/150**.

## Overworld Map

- Ports: currently 4 ports are important (they are all blue colored: NYC, Liverpool, Gibraltar, St. Pete), they have their own shop that refresh every 3 days and have daily missions **after you finished story**. It is recommended to unlock all of them after you finish story ASAP. 
- Comprises of regions which cost AP to enter (story regions has red exclamation mark on it cost 0 AP to enter and 0 AP to scan if they allow you). After clearing the story region, the game will force you to enter and clear the region normally and cost AP appropriately.
- Explanations of on screen markers:
   - Red exclamation marks: Main story markers, follow this until you finish the story. Finishing story (4-6) will unlock daily missions and weekly strongholds. More details are in the [Story Guide section](#story-guide)
   - Green clipboards = Puzzle Portals and Daily Quest markers (any side missions that show up in the Information tab will be marked as such)
   - Yellow chests = Fracture Sea/Obscured Zone/Treasure Map from blue coordinates in storage (alternate zone that will have you clear some rally points for loot, using the teleporter will move you back to the region b4 you enter)
   - Gold coin icon = just rewards markers for AP chest/healing boxes/coins (mostly shown as rewards for regions you haven't controlled)
   - Blue Hexagon icon = respective Adaptive stat boost, click on it to see details on which stat if you aren't familiar with adaptive stat icon(shown as rewards for regions you haven't controlled)
   - Red boss icon = One time entry Abyssal Zones from Red coordinates. If you leave after unlocking the gate to spawn the boss, the boss will disappear. Can drops high quality loot (up to rainbow mats). Detailed description is in the [Abyss Zone section](#abyssal-zones)
   - Swirling Abyss = Strongholds (level 128 enemies with 144/144/144 stat) cost 100 AP ONCE to enter and can be retreated freely for repairs. Only spawn after finishing story. Can drops high quality loot (rainbow mats).

## Shop Guide:
- There are 3 main currency: Supply Coins, Item Tokens and Energy Storage Device (ESDs). Tokens and ESDs are used in some events.
- Akashi shop (random event in region maps) sells the following:
   - Tokens packs: for coins. Buy these always.
   - AP boxes: for coins. Buy these if you want to grind more. Highly recommended but not mandatory since they do not get converted to vouchers.
   - Healing kits: for coins. Don't buy these if you aren't short on it, mostly not needed since you get more than enough of it from drops. They also don't get converted to vouchers
   - Tuning samples: increases their respective stat for ESDs. Only buy when below the Adaptive stat break point above (200/200/150)
- Port shops (refresh every 3 days, all 4 ports share the same 150 items pool that are fixed every cycle):
   - Plates: Rainbow and Gold plates for Tokens. Buy these always. **(Highest Priority)**
   - Gold and Rainbow Design blueprints for Tokens. Buy these always. **(Highest Priority)**
   - Blue and Red Coordinates for Tokens. Blue leads to Obscured Zone/Treasure Maps. Red leads to Abyssal Zone. Buy these always. Rainbow colored Coords leads to C6 Abyss zones which drop high tier quality loot which are **Highest Priority** should the player are able to clear it (the boss is level 128).
   - Tokens packs: for coins. Buy these if short of tokens. You get more than enough if you do your strongholds consistently.
   - AP boxes: for coins. Buy these if you want to grind more.
   - Tuning samples: for Tokens/Coins. Buy only when below 200/200/150.
   - The 4 META ship enhancement materials: Ignore these are fine. Only buy if you are swimming in Tokens/Coins. It helps for enhancing META ships but you 
   - ESDs for tokens: buy if you are really short on them to do random events. Bad conversion rate to vouchers so keep about 5-8 in storage is good enough since you will drop more eventually.
   - Gear materials: Skip blue and purple, you'll be swimming in it soon enough. **Buy gold gear mat boxes are medium-high priority since some mats are heavily used (Gold Electronics)**.
   
## Regional Map

- Think of it as normal maps in every chapter in main campaign (and AP as the 10 oil cost to enter). Region's difficulty is based on star/corrosion level which scale up the AP cost (80 AP region has level 114 mobs and 118 boss, 60 AP has level 103-104, 108 boss. Abyss cost up to 60/80/100 AP and spawn 102/114/120 boss, Stronghold cost 200 AP fixed and have 122 mobs to 128 boss)
- Every fleet has their movement restricted in turns (much like event maps where you have limited movement tiles). Same concept here but turns actually have an effect on the map. The map is semi-dynamic in that mobs might spawn in over time (like in Obscured Zone), cat salvages overtime (10 turns), discovering elite fleets (enhanced enemies with modules and more drops as well as spawn a random event when defeated) when you meet them on the map.
- Recon reveal the entire map so scanning mode will reveal hidden cache/read cache descriptions easier.
- Retreating from a region requires a fleet at the edge of the map if you haven't cleared it. If you have, just click outside.
- The hardest currently available regions are: Strongholds and High Corrosion 6 Abyss Coordinates.
- Strongholds reset once a week (likely monday) to a cap of 3, they have level 128 bosses and mobs which can be hard if under adaptive stats.
- Abyssal zones spawn when using Coordinates Loggers in Storage. Can have multi-stage bosses (ranging from 108 to 120) who will show a weakness after a certain hp threshold.
- Reinforcements (colored blue rather than red) drops no exp or loot.

## Map stars
- Each map has 5 stars you can get. Star 4 and 5 are for now "???" meaning the condition is hidden, you will see what it is when you get stars 3 and 4 respectively.
- Press information -> exploration progress to show the  objectives for the current area. 3 objectives are revealed on the first time you enter an area.
- Star rewards can be claimed at ports. (there are 75 regions so dw about rushing this content)
- Some starring requirement are RNG. Most notable are Promoted Pawns spawn, Logger random event and Anomaly Weather node.
- [Here's the wiki table of all starring requirements and their respective rewards](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Operation_Siren_Exploration)
- Starring conditions always relates to random events generated on entry and not on Promoted Pawns/boss kills.
- **Bug workaround for "Take control of 1 region" star requirement"**:
   - Requirements: One uncompleted Fractured or Abyssal node. (Those are the treasure chests and red boss icons on the map.)
   - Step 1: Enter the safe zone map you already completed, the one whose "complete this map" star is missing. Clear it again. (The second time around, it will be quite easy cause there will be only two enemies and no hazards.) Make sure TB tells you not to forget to pick up your loot.
   - Step 2: Go directly to the Fractured or Abyssal map. Do not pass GO. Do not collect 200 dollars. Most importantly, do not return to port to heal or dillydally first. Go directly there. Then, of course, clear the Fractured or Abyssal map.
   - Step 3: When you leave the completed fractured map, leave through the teleporter that you get upon successful clear. Do not push "exit" in the lower right. Use the teleporter.
   - Step 4: It will dump you back out in the bugged map you came from, but this time there will be a spoils of war box in the middle of it. Collect it, and it will award you the completion star you never got.
   
## List of random event:

### Random event that happen on entry:
#### Anomaly weather zone:
RNG Starring condition, there's a hidden loot marker in its vicinity (revealed with scanning mode) coupled with some weather tiles (currents, windstorms, weird towers etc) that rewards adaptive stats.

#### Meowficers Node
Upon entering the tile you will be asked whether or not you want to deploy Meowficers to gather resources. If you choose to, your meowficcer skills will be disabled for 10 turns, then they will return with rewards. **Rewards are based on the Command Meowficcer levels and rarity.**

#### Siren Coordinate Logger
Looks like a oil rig with some cranes, moving on it and you will be ambushed twice and gain access to the device (usable 2-4 times). You can either spend 1 ESD to spawn a mob fleet (that doesn't drop modules) or 2 Tokens to spawn an [Energy Cache event](#energy-cache) or just a "Sparkle" loot which doesn't disappear but doesn't drop anything lucrative either.

#### Akashi's Shop:
She spawns upon entry to the map, shopping recommendation is in the [Shop Guide](#shop-guide)

#### General Loot:
Indicated by a "sparkle", a chest or a hidden (shown on radar and can be seen through scanning mode)

### Random event that happen after killing a boss node:
#### Siren floating rewards
Spawn 5 "sparkle" tiles, use scanning mode and click on individual tiles to know what will happen. List of events include: Loot, Ambush and Warning Device. You can only collect up to 3 Loot and the other 2 will disappear, Ambush fleet drops no rewards so skip is fine, Warning Device will deletes all remaining tiles.

#### Siren Jamming 
Box that spawn after defeating a boss. Scanning will show whether it will jam your fleet or not. Either reducing that fleet movement to 1 tile for the next 5 turns or make your fleet move twice in random direction after the next move. 

#### Energy Matrix:
Collect the Matrix on the map and deliver it to the platform to get rewards.

#### Energy Cache:
Go there, use the Energy Storage Device and you get some adaptive stat, if it fails, just smash it. Smashing seems to never give adaptive stat.

#### Siren Ambush:
Straight forward a Siren mob spawn right on top of your fleet. Killing it drop some loot.

#### Siren Rally Point:
Calls in reinforcement every 3 turns. Disabled when stepping on them.

#### Weather Anomaly:
Usually fogs or some directional currents spawn around the fleet in a 5x5 square. Look at the radar, go into the fog, destroy the Weather Control Tower marked with a "?" and get some loot.

## Obscured Zone/Fractured Sea/Treasure Map (Yellow Chests on map):
Treasure maps are generated peusdo-randomly like in roguelites with specific patterns with each "room" is a 5x5 square roughly making up the map dotted with some chests:
- Small map has only one slightly bigger room which has the rally point. (Sometimes have Akashi too)
- Medium map has 4 rooms: 2 rally points + 0-1 Weather control device + the rest are random events.
- Big map has 9 rooms: 1 light house + 3 rally points + 0-2 Weather control devices + the rest are random events.

#### Siren Rally Points
Siren rally points (Red Sparkles) will keep spawning reinforcement fleets until all of them are destroyed. You can destroy them by moving onto them, which will force you into a fight with a siren defense fleet. Defeating the fleet will remove the rally point. Reinforcement fleets (blue in color) spawn in infinitely and they don't drop any loot, they do give META ship skill exp however. Clearing all Rally points spawn the Teleporter and some chests (The clearing box usually have high tier loot). In big maps (9 rooms) clearing 2 rally points will spawn a siren fleet which will chase your fleet down but doesn't drop any loot.

#### Siren Weather Control Device:
Does what it said on the tin, go to it to disable whatever weather anomaly surrounding the Rally Points (water currents, windstorms, ice floes, fog, etc). Doesn't have any defensive ambush fleet on it.

#### Siren Data Center
A plus formation of obstacle constructs that spawn with a couple EMP tiles and 2 hidden Meowfficer nodes. If scanning mode doesn't reveal the meowfficer nodes right away, moving into the 5x5 room and (maybe) stepping on all of 3 EMP tiles will spawn them.
![](https://i.imgur.com/lWk3HpC.png)

#### Paired switches: 
Putting a fleet on both of the switches automatically will spawn loot and destroy the surrounding rocks.
![](https://i.imgur.com/EEtQWQq.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/COr0s2Y.png)

#### Chest surrounded by rocks:
The rocks will be removed after clearing all Siren Rally points. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/SEGUhsJ.png)

#### Anomaly Chest:
Inconspicuous chest which MIGHT fill the entire 5x5 area with a random weather event when opened (Flaming Sea, Frigid Waters or Whirlpools) which will also hide scanning mode from other event (e.g 4 Matrix event's hidden matrix tile). So it is recommended to open the chest last.
![](https://i.imgur.com/jUhDs4v.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/w6krEyF.png)

#### 4 Matrix Cache:
4 Matrix deposits surround a cache, move into the 5x5 zone of it will spawn the 4 matrixes hidden on the map (revealed with scanning mode). Putting matrix in will upgrade the cache content.
![](https://i.imgur.com/i4DGdgz.png)

#### Blockade
If the 5x5 Square has nothing in it, expect it to be this type of room. Walking into the 5x5 zone will lock your fleet in and either spawn 3 module buffed fleets OR 3 gate typed devices. Defeating all the module fleets OR choosing the right gate will lift the blockade (the wrong gate will have an ambush fleet). In the gate version, there will also be another gate outside of the 5x5 zone. Moving a fleet to the one spawn outside will destroy the fake gates in the zone. Cannot use scanning mode to bypass the gate holograms.
![](https://i.imgur.com/mdiH5FQ.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/eyJuggC.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/JOCPghx.png)

#### Light house:
ONLY spawn on big maps (9 rooms). Using an ESD here will perform a map recon. If one has already used the recon using the Order -> Recon, ignore this event.
![](https://i.imgur.com/FIL9rMc.png)

#### Akashi's Shop: same as above
![](https://i.imgur.com/H78OHXq.png)

### Weather Anomalies:

#### Ocean Current:
Moves your fleet to the next tile following the direction of the arrow when stepped on.

#### Directional Wind Vortex:
Will launch your fleet a set number of tiles over all obstacles when stepped on. The number of tiles travelled depends on the side of the vortex (1-4 tiles)

#### EMP tiles:
Cause random movement of your fleet for 1-2 turns when stepped on. Also disable chained movement.

#### Ice pillars and ice floes:
Ice pillars block movement entirely and sometimes can be removed by destroying the corresponding Siren Control Tower. Ice floes are ice tiles that will continue your fleet momentum till they come in contact with an obstacle or another fleet.

#### Fog
Movement in fog is restricted to 1 tile and you can only see up to one tile around you. Stronghold Fog allows 2 tiles of visibility. Sometimes there are Fog control tower that you can go to and remove the fog in the region.

#### Maelstrom
Entering or moving into a whirlpool will stop you there, and each time you try to move out you might be stunned, eating your moevement, giving time for potential reinforcements spawns and Siren to move closer. Movement out of the Whirlpool is restricted to 1 tile.

#### Flaming Sea:
Stop your movemnt, do a %hp damage to all unit in the fleet and persist for a turn. Can NOT kill off your ships so you can swim through it and heal up with repair kits after if needed.

#### Corrosive Sea:
Same as Flaming Sea above

#### Frigid Sea:
Decrease combat efficiency of the fleet (unclear on how much, best to avoid combat while affected by the debuff). Last up to 5 turns. Also disable chained movement.

#### Red Fog
Hazier and redder in color than Fog and also seems to block movement through it entirely, can only be removed by destroying the corresponding Siren Control Tower. (Don't exist outside of story region)

### Other notable tile type:
#### Colored blockers:
Present in Puzzle maps, using the corresponding colored control tower will turn pebbles into movement blocking contructs and vice versa. 

## Story Guide
First time you enter an area for the story it costs no AP, it will cost AP after that. They also do not give EXP except the boss fight iirc.
- Chapter 1: Enemy around level 62-68. After finishing all red markers, it will ask you to clear 6 regions in the NW section, just clear whatever lowest star level to unlock Chapter 2, Fleet 3 and 4, Ashes Showdown as well as the next region via Liverpool port. The game also forces you to do a Fleet Redeployment and have a fleet 3 and 4 else you are soft locked at Liverpool and can't leave.
- Chapter 2: Enemy around 72-78. Same concept, now you need to clear 7-8 region in this Liverpool region to unlock the next region. Unlocks Submarine fleet but doesn't soft lock you to the port.
- Chapter 3: Enemy around 82-88. Same concept, unlocks the last region and port Dakar (a red port).
- Chapter 4: Enemy around 92-98. Same concept but unlocks daily missions and Strongholds spawn.
- **Notable bug, unclear if it's fixed or not but is important to mention:** Finishing chapter 1-6 b4 clearing 6 regions in NW. THEN clearing 6 regions might result in a soft lock that the player will not be able to unlock Liverpool port. It is recommended to stray from the Red marker for a bit to clear 6 regions (some low level regions are fine, don't have to clear star level 6 regions) before continuing the story

## Enemies and Special Zones explanation:

#### Sirens
Sirens move 5 tiles every 3 turns, plan ahead if you want to avoid them with your fleets. You can also just retreat when they caught up, not much reason to fight them if they are just blue reinforcement that drop no loot.

#### Dangerous enemies (Mixed Recon/Main/Aviation Fleets)
Basically boss fleets. Have specialized modules that buff/debuff stats/defense making them harder or easier to kill with/without the proper damage type. The list of possible module buffs are [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Operation_Siren#Additional_effects)

#### Stat Table for Stronghold/Abyssal/META boss: ![](https://i.imgur.com/r0YyKLk.png)

#### Stronghold:
There are 7 zones present in a stronghold. You spawn with 2 controled zones and siren has 5 zones. There will always be an Invader CL Siren reinforcement that spawn in one of the 2 zones you initially control after you clear 2-3 zones which will steal that zone after 1-5 turns (This reinforcement will spawn chest spawn afterwards which total up to a zone rewards). The final Stronghold Siren boss are strong, they are not as tanky as Abyssal bosses but they hit very hard even before taking account of their module buffs. They are supposedly multi-staged boss. __**Remember that you can always retreat out of strongholds to return to Port to heal.**__ So stronghold isn't as hard in the sense that Abyss are, you will clear it eventually even if it takes a bit of time.

#### Abyssal Zones:
Currently only have 3 types of bosses: DD, CA and BB. Abyssal bosses reveal their weakness after certain hp thresholds. They all have below average AA stat making them susceptible to CV damage. CA and BB also have an uncanny weakness to Airstrikes while DD has weakness to shellings. They hit not as hard but they are twice to thrice as tanky compared to Stronghold bosses. The key to beating these Abyss bosses are to bring one well-equipped CV and BB fleet each. Also try to avoid any ship sinking because it will apply the "Damaged" debuff (red wrench on the hp bar) that disable skills to the ship that sunk which can only be removed with the Rest and Regroup in the Order Tab. Failing battle apply a "Low Resolve" debuff (triangle on the fleet chibi) that debuff all stats by 10% up to 3 times which can be removed by using a fleet to win against the mobs hidden in the fog which clear this debuff from ALL fleets. To get to them look at the 2 side of the map, there will be ways to get to the lanes in the side and travel to the fog and fight them.

## Ashes Showdown

#### TL;DR:
- Only unlocks after clearing chapter 1 of the OpSi story
- Doing daily missions, kill bosses, collect chests/loot spawns and you will accumulate coordinate points.

- If the game pops up an expired coordinate error, it means the boss already died.
